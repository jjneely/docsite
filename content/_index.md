I have always wanted a [wiki][1].  No a real wiki!  Well, what is a real wiki?
I grew up in the time where wikis used a text based format.  This format was
stored on disk directly, could be versioned, and was even readable when the web
server was offline.  This text based format eventually became what we know of
as [Markdown][2] today.  But a wiki that can be managed from [Git][3], peer
reviewed, and deployed with a pipeline seems a thing of the past.

Then I realized that [Hugo][4] could be used to create all the technical
documentation I needed.  What this doesn't handle is Markdown input directly
via the browser, but that can be handled by [GitHub's][5] or [GitLab's][6]
online editors easily.  This creates a fully automated and peer-reviewed system
for maintaining technical documentation.
